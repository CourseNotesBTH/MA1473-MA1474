Calculator programs and source for MA1473 & MA1474
======

These are installed to the calculator by transferring the `.8xp` and `.8xv` files available in each respective `bin` folder to a supported device. This is usually done by using the software 'TI Connect' for your specific calculator. To build or modify the source, the [CE-Programming toolkit](https://github.com/CE-Programming/toolchain) is needed.

All programs are written in C using the aforementioned toolkit.

More information is found in each respective README.
